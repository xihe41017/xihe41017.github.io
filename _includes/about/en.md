Hello,folks! I'm [@西赫xihe](xihe41017.top)（aka @喆 formerly known as 黄恩喆）from a small county in Zhangzhou, Fujian.  Born in November 2009, I’m currently a high school student with some knowledge of computer technology and am learning programming.

To most people, I’m just ~~a nobody~~. But hey, not everyone can be like [Lei Jun](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%9B%B7%E5%86%9B), who has such admirable abilities. What matters is that we try our best—living happily in this world and enjoying everything it offers.

As for programming, I’ve achieved a few small things. Check out the [chievements](#成就) section below.



#### Achievements

- 2022: Third Prize in Zhangzhou Robot Challenge

- 2023: Third Prize in Zhangzhou Virtual Robot Competition

- 2023: Second Prize in World Robot Contest (Fujian Division)

- 2023: Third Prize in World Robot Contest (International Finals)

- 2024: CSP-J (Junior) – First Prize (Round 1), Second Prize (Round 2)

> The last two can be verified on the [NOI official website](https://noi.cn/hjmd/mdcx) by searching "黄恩喆" (Huang Enzhe). 

These may not be grand accomplishments, but they hold great personal significance for me.
